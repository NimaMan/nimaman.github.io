# Ethereum Blockchain Investigations

This section documents technical investigations into suspicious patterns and unusual trading activity on the Ethereum blockchain. All investigations use publicly available on-chain data that can be independently verified.

## Current Investigation

### [COLON Token Launch - Trading Pattern Investigation](/ethereum/investigations/colon-token-investigation/)
*January 21, 2025*

**Key Finding**: 68 brand-new wallets somehow knew exactly when to submit transactions after a privately-submitted "open trading" transaction, capturing the vast majority of initial liquidity.

**Status**: Awaiting response from BuilderNet regarding transaction ordering mechanics.

## Investigation Methodology

All investigations follow strict standards:

1. **Data Source**: Direct from Ethereum blockchain via local Reth node
2. **Verification**: All claims backed by on-chain transaction hashes
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Probability calculations for organic vs coordinated activity
4. **Technical Focus**: Questions about mechanics, not accusations
5. **Transparency**: All evidence publicly verifiable

## Why These Investigations Matter

The Ethereum ecosystem relies on fair and transparent markets. When sophisticated actors exploit information asymmetries or coordinate to manipulate markets, it:

- Harms retail investors
- Reduces market integrity
- Discourages participation
- Concentrates wealth unfairly

By documenting these patterns with irrefutable blockchain evidence, we aim to:
- Increase transparency
- Educate the community
- Pressure bad actors to explain
- Support regulatory clarity

## Technical Background

These investigations often involve:
- **MEV (Maximum Extractable Value)**: How validators and builders can reorder transactions
- **Private Mempools**: Transactions submitted outside public view
- **Block Building**: How transactions are ordered within blocks
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating probability of organic activity
