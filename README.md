This repository hosts my personal website.

## Important Note

The website content is managed directly in the `gh-pages` branch. The `main` branch only contains this README.

To make changes to the website:
1. Switch to the `gh-pages` branch: `git checkout gh-pages`
2. Make your changes directly to the HTML/CSS/JS files
3. Commit and push your changes
4. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the updates

No build process or static site generator is required - the `gh-pages` branch contains the final website files that are served directly.
